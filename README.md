# ETL Assignment


### Introduction
Title of Article from Harvard Business Review: â€œData Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century." These are the types slogans and buzz that are bombarding social and business media. This project seeks to uncover the Canadian landscape for those who are seeking careers in this emerging high tech area. By analyzing data jobs being offered in websites like Indeed.com, and correlating them to the population and quality of life data where they are being offered, this project hopes to illuminate where the best opportunities and earning power can be found in Canada.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to explore the landscape of Data jobs across Canada, while using the concept of "'Extract', 'Transform', and 'Load'" in a practical application. Group 6 hoped to further understand where Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist positions are availabe in Canada, the salaries associated with each job, and the cost of living (depending on location) associated to each opportunity.

### Approach
To apply ETL, Group 6 chose to use Python to extract data from websites and APIs, Pandas to mung and clean the data gathered, and MySQL to store the data to complete the process of Extracting, Transforming, and Loading.
